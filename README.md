## Description

This is a simulation written for a case study of using PyDySoFu for realistic modelling of business systems. Specifically, this focuses on production lines, modelling Rob Dekkers' QPQ game.


## Experimental Design

What are the emergent phenomena we're expecting to see arising from the game?
Also, how can we expect those to change as players of the game begin to make mistakes?

I *think* Rob's game can use profit as a metric for this, but we'll have to verify / discuss this when meeting and discussing with him.
