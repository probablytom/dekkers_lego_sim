## Description

This is a simulation written for a case study of using PyDySoFu for realistic modelling of business systems. Specifically, this focuses on production lines, modelling Rob Dekkers' QPQ game.


## Experimental Design

What are the emergent phenomena we're expecting to see arising from the game?
Also, how can we expect those to change as players of the game begin to make mistakes?

I *think* Rob's game can use profit as a metric for this, but we'll have to verify / discuss this when meeting and discussing with him.

##Â Possible variances

* Mismanagement
  * (mistakes at a high level for each part of the domain model)
  * shuffled steps or missing steps? Should consult with Rob about what mismanagement might look like from a variance perspective.
* Inattention
  * low-level mistakes resulting in the wrong part being ordered, or a missing step, such as a poorly fixed gps module
* Miscommunication
  * Order form getting jumbled up in the middle of the handover between parts of the organisation

## Work to do

[] Finish building the skeleton of the domain model
[] Work out what variances would make sense
