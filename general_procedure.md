# General procedure:

Here's the general procedure that the company will go through, missing the Order Penetration Point for obvious reasons.

* Design a product
* Fabricate parts for design
* Construct product
* Ship product

Broken down into sub-steps:

* Design product
  * Verify design until design passes requirements
* While constructing new units:
    * Fabricate parts for design
      * Contact supplier with parts to be fabricated
      * Wait for delivery of parts
      * Receive parts
      * Re-order until parts are the expected parts
